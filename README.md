# [VideoDB Director Agent](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-VideoDbDirector-Agent)

VideoDB Director Agent is a specialized AI agent that processes, analyzes, and extracts insights from video content using advanced AI capabilities. It can watch videos, translate video content, generate summaries, extract key moments, answer questions about video content, and provide detailed analysis through natural language interactions within the Coral Protocol ecosystem.

## Responsibility
VideoDB Director Agent serves as an intelligent video content analyzer and processor that can understand, interpret, and respond to queries about video content. It handles video watching, transcription, summarization, question answering, and content analysis tasks. The agent processes video URLs (YouTube, local files, etc.), extracts meaningful information, and provides comprehensive insights through natural language responses, making video content accessible and searchable through conversational AI interactions.

## Details
- **Framework**: LangChain
- **Tools used**: VideoDB MCP Tools, Coral MCP Tools
- **AI model**: GPT-4.1-mini, supports configurable LLM providers
- **Date added**: July 2025
- **License**: MIT

## Setup the Agent

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies

<details>  

```bash
# In a new terminal clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-VideoDbDirector-Agent.git

# Navigate to the project directory:
cd Coral-VideoDbDirector-Agent

# Install `uv`:
pip install uv

# Install dependencies from `pyproject.toml` using `uv`:
uv sync
```

</details>

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Get the required credentials:
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or other LLM provider
- [VideoDB API Key](https://videodb.io/) for video processing services

<details>

```bash
# Create .env file in project root
cp -r env.example .env
```

Required environment variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your LLM provider API key
- `VIDEODB_API_KEY`: VideoDB platform API key for video processing

Optional environment variables:
- `MODEL_NAME`: LLM model name (default: "gpt-4o")
- `MODEL_PROVIDER`: LLM provider (default: "openai")
- `MODEL_TOKEN`: Max tokens (default: "4000")
- `MODEL_TEMPERATURE`: Model temperature (default: "0.3")

</details>

## Run the Agent

You can run in either of the below modes to get your system running.  

- The Executable Model is part of the Coral Protocol Orchestrator which works with [Coral Studio UI](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-studio).  
- The Dev Mode allows the Coral Server and all agents to be separately running on each terminal without UI support.  

### 1. Executable Mode

Checkout: [How to Build a Multi-Agent System with Awesome Open Source Agents using Coral Protocol](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/existing-agent-sessions-tutorial-private-temp) and update the file: `coral-server/src/main/resources/application.yaml` with the details below, then run the [Coral Server](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-server) and [Coral Studio UI](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-studio). You do not need to set up the `.env` in the project directory for running in this mode; it will be captured through the variables below.

```

For Windows, create a powershell command (run_agent.ps1) and run:

```bash
command: ["powershell","-ExecutionPolicy", "Bypass", "-File", "${PROJECT_DIR}/run_agent.ps1","main.py"]
```

</details>

### 2. Dev Mode

Ensure that the [Coral Server](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-server) is running on your system and run below command in a separate terminal.

<details>

```bash
# Run the agent using `uv`:
uv run main.py
```
</details>
